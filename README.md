# Scrum Board Simulator
or: Scrum Game. It is a simulation of a Scrum Board where the idea is that you can play with different variables such as
team, team velocity, sprint length, stories and story sizes, work-in-progress limits and random disasters such as
unplanned work and see how it affects the Sprint and how much waste is created.
